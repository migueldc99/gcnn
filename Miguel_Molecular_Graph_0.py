    r"""

    This function reads molecule information from the database file and 
    converts it to DGL (Deep Graph Learning) graph. A graph can be 
    constructed in one of two ways:

    1. Chemically intuitive way: a node (atom) has edges only to 
       other nodes that are at a distance that is 1.1 times the 
       sum of their respective covalent radii away. In this mode
       edges will correspond to chemical bonds. To activate this 
       mode it is necessary to pass the dictionary covalentRadii;
       if it is not passed or is set to None, the second mode is
       activated (see below).

    2. Geometrical way: each node will have a minimum of nMaxNeighbours
       nearest nodes; this is a minimum number because the graph 
       should be undirected, meaning that if j is neighbour of i, 
       i must be a neighbour of j, even if i is not among the 
       nMaxNeighbours nearest neighbours of j; therefore the 
       actual number of neighbours of a node is at least equal
       to nMaxNeighbours, but in fact can be slightly larger.

    Args:

       fileName (string): the path to the file where the molecule 
           information is stored.

       atoms_features: a dictionary (keys=elements symbols, values = node 
           features) containing the node features.

       edge_features (Features): instance of Features class to 
           calculate edge features related to the distance between
           the nodes i-j defining the edge.

       bond_angle_features (Features): instance to compute bond-angle
           features for each node, akin to a histogram of bond-angles
           formed by the nearest-neighbour nodes of node i. If an atom
           i has only one neighbour, it does not define any bond angles
           so its bond_angle features would be zero. These kind of 
           features are associated to nodes, and are concatenated to
           the "chemical" features specifying elements, etc.

       dihedral_features (Features): similar to bond_angle_features above,
           an instance of Features to encode information about the 
           dihedral angles formed by the neighbours k of node i and l of 
           node j, where i-j define the edge; these are edge features, 
           to be concatenated to the distance-related edge features;
           if not given, default None, in which case they are not used.
 
       covalentRadii: dictionary dict( elements:radius in Angstrom ); if 
           not given (None), neighbours are instead found using the next
           parameter, choosing the nearest nMaxNeighbours to each node.

       nMaxNeighbours: number of nearest neighbours (this is a minimum 
           number; in general it may be slightly larger so as to ensure 
           that graphs are undirected (if i is neighbour of j, j is a 
           neighbour of i).

    Return:
        
        moleculeGraph (dgl.graph): a graph containing the molecule features.
